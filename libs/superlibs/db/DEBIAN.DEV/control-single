Description: ObTools generic database libraries (single-threaded dev. files)
 The ObTools database library provides a generic database interface in C++.
 This is the generic support library, which requires a specific driver
 library to actually do anything useful
 .
 This package is in addition to libot-db-dev and provides development 
 files for building *single threaded* applications which use the library
