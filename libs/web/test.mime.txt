Header: Value
Header:    Value   with   LWS   in it
Another:  Very long value which due to its extreme length
          has had to be split across 
 several lines
Another:  This is another long value, but this one contains commas, 
          so it should get split cleanly at them,but note that last 
          one didn't have a space after it,
Foo: Value1, Value2,Value3
Foo: Value4,
Foo: Value5
Split: Main thing;one=one;  two  =  two;blank=;alone; 
Blank:
Dodgy: This line ends with LF
Final: That's all folks

This is the body
And this is some more
