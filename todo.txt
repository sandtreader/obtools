ObTools ToDo:

Libs
----

XML:
 - Better errors - count lines, show guilty tag names/lines (open and close)

DB:
 - Transactions
 - Postgres last ID???  Maybe exec_insert(), returning ID inserted

CLI:
 - Provide help in groups if not recognised
 - Show group prefix in help

XMLMesh
------

Current:
  forward: otmp client transport - use client library
  subscribe: ditto

Future:
  ** Redesign dispatch - more configurable routing, thread management **

  authentication/filtering of incoming msgs

  Multipath resilience - keep time-limited map of message [orig,id], 
    suppress duplicates   

  Allow long-term correlation for registration/multiple response?

  Worker thread pool for dispatch??

  Dynamic loading of modules?

Client:
  pure virtual call if info message received while waiting for 
  request response?

XMITools
