ObTools build notes

Cross-compilation
-----------------

Currently uses mingw to cross compile from Linux onto Windows.  Not tested
compiling natively on Windows under MinGW or commercial IDEs.  There are some 
remnant borland.mak files for libraries lying around, but these are 
seriously out of date.

To install MinGW under Debian:

# apt-get install mingw32

To build cross-compiled versions

$ make cross

Threads in cross-compiled versions
----------------------------------

To build the MT threaded code (that is, most of it!), you need the 
'pthreads-win32' packages from 

ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32/dll-latest

We use the GC version - Gnu compiler, no exception handling (we don't 
expect C++ EH in thread cancellation in libpthread, so no reason to expect
it here either).  So...

1) Copy {pthread,semaphore,sched}.h to /usr/lib/i586-mingwmsvc/3.4.2/include/
(your version may vary)

2) Copy libpthreadGC2.a to /usr/lib/i586-mingwmsvc/3.4.2/

3) Copy pthreadGC2.dll to Windows PATH
