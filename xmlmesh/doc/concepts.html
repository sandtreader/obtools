<H1>XMLMesh: The Concepts</H1>

<P>XMLMesh is a system for connecting elements of a distributed
solution together with XML messaging, using a client-server model with a Publish-Subscribe metaphor.</P>
<P>This document gives a conceptual overview of the XMLMesh design, without going into too much programming detail.</P>

<H2><A NAME="cs">The client-server model</A></H2>

<P>The <A HREF="server.html">XMLMesh server</A> acts as a point of
connection for multiple <A HREF="clients.html">XMLMesh clients</A>,
using a simple TCP protocol called 'Object Toolsmiths Message
Protocol', or <strong>OTMP</strong>.</P>

<P>Clients can send messages, either as a 'one way' broadcast, or a 'request-response' pair.  Clients can also <em>subscribe</em> to receive messages of a particular type, and if required, return responses to them.</P>

<DIV CLASS=diag><IMG CLASS=diag SRC="client-server.png"></DIV>

<P>One key advantage of this model is that you can add a new client
without having to change either the server or any existing client.
The sender of an informational message doesn't have to know who, if
anyone, will receive it.  Also, the server and clients can be on the
same machine or different machines, at your choice.  This makes a
system built on top of XMLMesh very flexible and future-proof.</P>

<P>[Future versions will allow 'daisy chaining' of servers to provide
an even more distributed structure.]</P>

<H2><A NAME="msg">Structure of a message</A></H2> 

<P>The core of an XMLMesh message consists simply of any valid XML
(including plain text), tagged with a <em>subject</em>.  XMLMesh does
not specify the content of the XML at all, except for some simple core
messages to make life easier (even these are optional).</P>

<H3>The message subject</H3>
<P>The subject is used to route the message to clients according to
their subscriptions, and is conventionally a list of words separated
by dots, in a hierarchy.  Some typical subjects might be:</P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN class=code>log.info</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN class=code>log.critical</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN class=code>status.sensor.V23</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN class=code>purchase.confirm</SPAN></LI>
</UL>

<P>As we will see later, a client can use the hierarchical nature of
the subject to subscribe to multiple subjects at once.</P>

<P>Choice of subjects is a matter of style, but we find it helps to think about how to use XMLMesh 'properly' if you use subjects according to the following conventions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>For 'one way' messages and responses to requests, use <em>declarative</em> language, such as 'status' and 'confirmed'</LI>
<LI>For request messages, use <em>active</em> language, such as 'confirm' and 'create'</LI>
</UL>

<P>The reason for this distinction is that it is very common (and one
of the main intentions of the XMLMesh design) for 'one way' messages
to be received by multiple clients <em>who may not be known to the
sender</em>.  By making declarative statements rather than asking
someone to do something, you are stating facts which may be of use to
anyone, rather than assuming how they will be used.  Another corollary
of this idea is that you should use 'one way' messages wherever
possible, since a 'request' message can only be answered by a single
receiver.</P>

<P>Also, it is a good idea not to overload the subjects with too much
information - just include the information you think would be useful
for routing.  For example, we've included the sensor name in '<SPAN
class=code>status.sensor.V23</SPAN>' because in our imaginary scenario
we might want to watch certain sensors and not others.</P>

<H3>Request-Response</H3>
<P>An XMLMesh message also has an <em>ID</em>, which allows
correlation of responses with requests, and an optional <em>RVSP</em> flag to indicate whether a response is expected.  Response messages have a
<em>reference</em>, which refers to the ID of the message they are
responding to.</P>

<H3>Examples</H3>
<P>Here are some basic XMLMesh messages:</P>
<PRE class=xml>
&lt;xmlmesh:message subject="log.info">
  08:35 Logging started
&lt;/xmlmesh:message>

&lt;xmlmesh:message subject="status.sensor.V23">
  &lt;status sensor="V23" status="active" value="193.4"/>
&lt;/xmlmesh:message>

&lt;xmlmesh:message subject="purchase.confirm" id="OTM-42" rsvp="yes">
  &lt;purchase order="1264487" account="600329" price="129.99"/>
&lt;/xmlmesh:message>

&lt;xmlmesh:message subject="purchase.confirmed" 
                 id="OTM-309" ref="OTM-42">
  &lt;confirmation ticket="4345GB90003"/>
&lt;/xmlmesh:message>
</PRE>

<P>The last pair of messages are a request-response, asking a billing system for confirmation of a purchase.  The billing system responds with a 'ticket' number confirming the purchase.</P>

<H3>Namespaces</H3> 
It is good practice to use XML Namespaces to define your XML messages, to 
ensure people can mix them with their own without conflict.  XMLMesh uses its own namespace for the &lt;xmlmesh:message> 'wrapper', and we suggest you define your own for the contents.</P>
<P>Hence a full XMLMesh message might be:</P>
<PRE class=xml>
&lt;xmlmesh:message xmlns:xmlmesh="obtools.com/xmlmesh"
                 subject="ecommerce.order.create" id="OTM-42">
  &lt;ec:create-order xmlns:ec="somedomain.com/ecommerce/2.1" account="932145">
    &lt;ec:order-item item="AG9934-B" quantity="4"/>
    &lt;ec:order-item item="ZF2148-X" quantity="1" backorder="yes"/>
  &lt;/ec:create-order>
&lt;/xmlmesh:message>
</PRE> 

<H2><A NAME="pubsub">Publish and Subscribe</A></H2>

<P>The XMLMesh server doesn't do anything itself; it just routes
messages between clients.  Some of the XMLMesh clients may be
'clients' in the conventional sense - making requests and receiving
responses; while others will be 'servers' in the conventional sense -
receiving requests and returning responses.  The XMLMesh structure
doesn't define which is which, and 'servers' are commonly 'clients'
for other 'servers' in order to get their work done.</P>

<P>To receive messages of a certain type (<em>subject</em>), an
XMLMesh client subscribes to that subject at the XMLMesh server.
There is a wildcard scheme (as in filenames) which allows a client to
subscribe for multiple subjects at once:</P>

<TABLE class=def CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>
<TR><TH>Subject</TH><TH>Meaning</TH></TR>
<TR><TD><SPAN class=code>log.info</SPAN></TD><TD>Just 'log.info' messages</TD></TH>
<TR><TD><SPAN class=code>log.*</SPAN></TD><TD>Any messages with subjects beginning with 'log.'</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><SPAN class=code>status.sensor.[PVX]*</SPAN></TD><TD>Any messages with subjects beginning with 'status.sensor.' followed by 'P', 'V' or 'X'</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><SPAN class=code>*</SPAN></TD><TD>All messages</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<H2><A NAME="real">A real-world example</A></H2>

<P>The following diagram shows the message flows in a typical
real-world example, of an online 'e-commerce' ordering system:</P>

<DIV CLASS=diag><IMG CLASS=diag SRC="ecommerce.png"></DIV>

<P>The usual order of play here would be:</P>
<OL>
<LI><SPAN class=code>order.create</span> - user wants to order something
<LI><SPAN class=code>order.created</span> - catalogue system confirms this
<LI><SPAN class=code>purchase.confirm</span> - user wants to pay
<LI><SPAN class=code>purchase.confirmed</span> - billing system confirms payment
<LI><SPAN class=code>order.shipped</span> - shipping has sent the order
</OL>

<P>There would of course be many more messages in a real system, but the concepts remain the same.</P>

<P>A few things to note:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Each component just deals with the messages it understands.</LI>

<LI>The auditor sucks up all the messages for its audit trail, without
any of the other components needing to know it is there.

<LI>The shipping component just publishes what it knows - an order has
shipped - without worrying about who is going to want to know.  In fact, it is received by both the catalogue system and the billing
interface (and the omnipresent auditor!).
</UL>

<H3>Sharing information</H3>

<P>One final note: You <em>can</em> be 'purist' and have every
communication between components in the system expressed as XMLMesh
messages.  However, it's quite acceptable to share information in
other ways - for example, with shared access to a database.</P>

<P>In the diagram above, for example, we hint that the Web interface
and catalogue system share a product database without going through XMLMesh.
This makes sense when there is a lot of complex data to share.
However, it is a good principle to ensure that
<em>changes</em> to the database are always triggered by an XMLMesh
message - that way, there are fewer problems with locking, and the
changes can always be picked up by an auditor component, as here.</P>
