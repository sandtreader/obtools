  <!-- Logging configuration

       'level' is one of:

         0 - Silence
         1 - Errors only
         2 - Session start/stop (default)
         3 - Details & intermediate changes
         4 - Debug
         5 - Everything imaginable 

       Production builds are only capable of outputting to level 3

       'file' (default /var/log/obtools/xmlmesh.log) gives log file  

       'timestamp' gives strftime(3) format for timestamp prefix,
       with extensions: %*S = seconds+milliseconds, %*L = log level
       Plain text can also be added.  If empty, nothing is added
